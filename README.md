# Diffusion Self-Guidance for Controllable Image Generation

This repo is an unofficial implementation of ["Diffusion Self-Guidance for Controllable Image Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00986) (Epstein et al., 2023), built with Stable Diffusion. All code and experiments are contained inside the notebook file â€” the clean version is just code, and the other one includes experiments.
